# TRACEVE MAPS

## Current Usage
- Download map_sibgen.html (click on file and and hit download button on the right side)
- open .html file in browser

## Use Streamlit
NOTE: Currently this does not work properly (the raster files are not loading, only VPOs and park boundaries can be interacted with...no clue why...)

Click on following link and give it a go:
https://mapstraceve.streamlit.app/

## For even more interactivity use QGIS
- Download maps_traceve.qgz
- open project in QGIS

NOTE: You dont have to download the data as the files are loaded via https directly from the source

## Updates
Updates will be made regularly to this repo by adding new files but also by updating existing layers if necessary
